**__Guideline__**

     » Proper grammar is required when delivering, you are representing the bot and it's entire community.

     » Be polite, even if the customer lashes out at you, there's no reason to lash back. Leave the server or alert a manager if they are harassing people through feedback or ordering.

     » Inactivity will result in you being demoted without warning. If you are to be gone for a while, please alert a manager beforehand, any explanations after will most likely get you the "lol ok" response.

     » Use common sense. If the bot isn't online, it means it's down. Do not spam Fires' DMs, just report it in #error-report. NO PINGING OF THE PINGS

     » Search up orders beforehand if you don't know what they are. If you get `ben and jerry's phish food`, don't just go "what the hell is that?" and deny it *just because you don't know what it is.* If you actually find nothing, fair enough.
