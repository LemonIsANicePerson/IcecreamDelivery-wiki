**__Should I accept?__**

If the order asks for something plain, "strawberry", for example, you can assume they're asking for strawberry ice cream. You shouldn't be delivering anything other than ice cream related items or the items listed in `Exceptions`. 

NSFW, non ice cream items and communication should all be warned for, an example is:
"That's not an appropriate order, please order ice cream."

If the customer continues, tell them they will be blacklisted if they don't stop. If they *still* continue, get the attention of someone from Management. (They have the management role, if you fail to see that, I don't know why you were accepted but they're listed in `Contact`.)

Can't photoshop? Deny it saying you can't find the item or let someone else that's on duty do it.

**Exceptions;**
Milkshakes
Frozen Yogurt
