**__What do I do?__**

     » Accept the order (Look at `Should I accept?` for more information on what to accept.)

     » Find or create their order (Photoshop, Paint, etc. A nice free program to use is Medibang Paint Pro and Paint if you can't afford photoshop but still want to make/collage orders. Paint is easier to use but Medibang has more advanced features, but the best thing is Google.)

     » Deliver the order (An invite link will be sent to your via DMs.)

     » Send the order over to the customer along with a nice message! An example:

"Hello @Fires#1043! Thanks for ordering with the Ice Cream Delivery bot, enjoy your order and be sure to leave some feedback with <feedback `{feedback}`!"

     » Leave the server after unless you know they're okay with you staying.

**EXTRA**
If the server doesn't allow you to send images, send the link instead. However;
`https://cn.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=k7vpwsss&id=BE02D847BD5D2B04216D8DC1C7CD2BC3A8BF3E45&thid=OIP.k7vpwsssPzoi5nAr0-Mp6QDREs&q=lemon+ice+cream&simid=608018193764715865&selectedIndex=6&ajaxhist=0`, is ugly. Don't send that.

`http://www.sohowsittaste.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SuperLemonIceCream.jpg` is better.

You can also upload the image to Imgur or any other photo sharing site and send that instead.
